# Becoming a SysAdmin – 30-Day Job Prep Journey 🚀

Welcome! I'm **Aiman Malik**, an aspiring Linux System Administrator currently undergoing a 30-day journey to refine my skills and apply for real-world jobs.

Every day, I'm documenting my learning, building scripts, solving admin tasks, and preparing to land a sysadmin role — all in public, right here.

## 📌 Why This Series?
This series is the essence of what I’ve learned in the past year.
I wanted to compile everything into one actionable roadmap — to stay consistent, build in public, and help others along the way.
